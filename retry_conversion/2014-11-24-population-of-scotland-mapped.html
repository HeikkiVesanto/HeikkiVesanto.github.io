<p>An updated version can be found at: <a href="http://gisforthought.com/every-person-in-scotland-on-the-map/">Every Person in Scotland on the Map</a></p>
<p>One random point on the map for each person within a postcode in Scotland.</p>
<p>Workflow:<br />
OS Code-Point Open points.<br />
><br />
Voronoi polygons from the postcodes.<br />
><br />
Join 2011 Scottish Census postcode population counts to Voronoi polygons.<br />
><br />
Clip the resulting polygons to the Scottish coastline (using PostGIS for time saving).<br />
><br />
Intersect the lakes out of the resulting polygons.<br />
><br />
Random point in polygon into the postcode Voronoi polygons (minus lakes), using the census counts.<br />
><br />
Output:</p>

<p>An easier approach would have been to use the NRS supplied postcode areas for Scotland mentioned in <a href="http://gisforthought.com/open-uk-postcode-polygons/" title="Open UK Postcode Polygons">previous posts</a>. A better display of this data would be through a web mapping environment, which is working on my home environment but lacking hosting.</p>
