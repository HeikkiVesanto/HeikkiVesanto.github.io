<p>As a follow up to <a title="Scotland&rsquo;s Connections to the Wider World" href="http://gisforthought.com/scotlands-connections-to-the-wider-world/" target="_blank">Scotland's connections to outside the UK</a>, here are the connections between Scotland and the rest of the UK. Missing is the bus network.</p>
<p>The train lines are drawn between stops on the route, so a direct train from London to Glasgow would be a straight line between the two terminus stations.</p>
<p>The real interesting thing is that there is a <a title="Cross_country" href="http://www.crosscountrytrains.co.uk/tickets-timetables/routes" target="_blank">crosscountry train running from Glasgow to Penzance.</a></p>
