<p>Catchy title. This is just highlighting a dataset that has been made available through the Glasgow Future Cities project: <a href="http://data.glasgow.gov.uk/dataset/corporate-address-gazetteer-cag" title="Glasgow CAG">Glasgow CAG</a>.</p>

<p>The Glasgow Corporate Address Gazetteer (CAG) contains property co-ordinates, classification, and address among other information.</p>
<p>Example of classifications in west end of Glasgow. Slightly difficult to use due to the gazetteer nature but the Scottish Data Transfer Format (SDTF) format is provided with the data.</p>
