<p>One of the main ways of generating postcode polygons is to use OS Code-Point Open and from them generate Voronoi polygons.</p>
<p>This visualization compares the Code-Point Voronoi polygons to postcodes from <a href="http://www.gro-scotland.gov.uk/" title="NRS">NRS </a><a href="http://www.gro-scotland.gov.uk/geography/geo-prods/postcode-extract/index.html">postcode extract</a>, Which is widely considered the best postcode dataset for Scotland. Scotland is used because we have a CAG (NLPG in the south) extract for Glasgow available for a property comparison of accuracy.</p>
<p>The black areas are where the two datasets agree and the coloured areas are where they do not. For this comparison we can consider NRS to be correct.</p>
