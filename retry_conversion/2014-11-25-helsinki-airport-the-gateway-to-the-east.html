<p>The shortest route between two points on the earth is a great circle. This is a straight line on a globe, but ultimately looks like half-circle when projected.</p>
<p>Due to Helsinki Airports location, it is an ideal hub for East Asia travel. Starting at practically any European city and travelling to Far East Asia via Helsinki. The final route will almost be a straight line.</p>
