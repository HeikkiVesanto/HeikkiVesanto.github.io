It is said locally the Mass as celebrated in a crevice in its west side during Penal times'.   In 1826 the following account was given; 'On the S. side of Lough Gur, is a very large and high rock full of chasms and hollows, called in Irish, the Mass Rock; which name it received from the circumstance of Mass being said in a hollow of this rock, during the Civil Wars of the 17th century, when its public celebration was prohibited by the English parliament' (Fitzgerald and McGregor 1826, 315).    The top of the rock outcrop is covered in scrub vegetation and is not accessible, there is a small cave like recess on the SW face of the rock which may have served as a shelter for the altar. \r\n\r\nCompiled by: Caimin O'Brien\r\n\r\nDate of upload: 5 July 2018 ", "CLASSDESC": "Mass-rock", "SMRS": "LI032-028001-", "TLAND_NAMES": "LOUGHGUR", "x": -8.52356, "y": 52.50974 }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -8.5235644, 52.5097377 ] } },

Clonlea church (CL043-027001-) is 170m to the N and Tobersenan holy well (CL043-028----) is on the opposite side of the lake. An irregularly shaped, natural, earthfast boulder (L 2.6m N-S; 1.65m E-W; max. H 0.75m) with a flattish top at W. There are natural white vertical striations on the W face. A plain cross (0.2m x 0.13m) formed of shallow grooves (Wth 0.02m) is carved on the top W face partially using some of these striations. Small incised lines seem to represent attempts to enhance the top of the cross. A second smaller cross on the top of the N face (0.11m x 0.09m) is formed of two very narrow incised lines. The boulder is largely moss-covered and is sheltered by an adjacent tree to S. A few rough stones, not quite forming a path, have been placed near the boulder at W. An iron cross leans against the boulder at SW. A stone bearing three crosses and a date of 1655 was found at the water’s edge some 30m away which would imply that the Mass-rock was used in the Cromwellian period. This stone is on display in Clare Museum. Some local traditions are associated with the mass-rock.\r\n\r\nThe following images have been uploaded:\r\nCL043-124----_01.jpg View of mass-rock from E.\r\nCL043-124----_02.jpg Cross at top of W face.\r\nCL043-124----_03.jpg Small incised cross on highest point of N face.\r\nCL043-124----_04.jpg View of mass-rock from W.\r\nCL043-124----_05.jpg Mass-rock from N in lakeside setting.\r\nCL043-124----_06.jpg View from NW.\r\n\r\nCompiled by: Mary Tunney\r\n\r\nDate of upload: 4 October 2018", "CLASSDESC": "Mass-rock", "SMRS": "CL043-124----", "TLAND_NAMES": "CLONLEA", "x": -8.73714, "y": 52.80503 }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -8.737142, 52.8050299 ] } },
