<p>A lot of progress has been made since my last visit: <a href="http://gisforthought.com/visiting-the-great-polish-map-of-scotland/">Visiting the Great Polish Map of Scotland</a></p>
<p>This time I had a bit more time, staying overnight with the very accomodating girlfirend at the Barony Castle Hotel. The steak was excellent, but the sauna was not very hot. Overall a good experience though.</p>
