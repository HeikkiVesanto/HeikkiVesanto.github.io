<p>In honour of the Forth Road Bridge re-opening completely. I created a map of the impact it has had on drive times from Edinburgh.</p>
<p>This is based on the OS Open Roads Product, using pgRouting, and network generated using the guide from <a href="http://ghost.mixedbredie.net/pgrouting-and-os-open-roads/">Ross McDonald</a>.</p>
<p>This does not take into account the increase of traffic on the other routes, or traffic in general. Would be interesting to see a real impact map from one of the major navigation providers.</p>
