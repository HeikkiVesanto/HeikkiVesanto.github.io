<p>I have two plugins in the QGIS plugin repository, and with the release of QGIS 3 looming it was time to upgrade them for QGIS 3.</p>
<p>There is a short guide by the QGIS dev team that is a good starting point at:<br /><a href="https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/wiki/Plugin-migration-to-QGIS-3">https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/wiki/Plugin-migration-to-QGIS-3</a></p>
<p>But I had not done any development on these plugins for a while so a more step by step guide was useful, so hopefully, write the guide for the first plugin and follow it step by step for the second.</p>
<p>I am working on Windows, with OSGeo4W.</p>
<p>Before we start we will need to insure a couple of extras are installed through the OSGeo4w Installer:<br />Desktop:<br />qgis-dev<br />Libs:<br />python-future</p>
<p>Assuming GitHUB is the repo.<br />In git shell:</p>
<pre class="lang:sh decode:true ">git clone https://github.com/HeikkiVesanto/QGIS_Multi_Ring_Buffer.git</pre>
<p>There is a conversion script for QGIS plugins provided by the QGIS devs in the main repo.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong><br />The qgis2to3 packages can be found on pip now:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/opengisch/qgis2to3/">https://github.com/opengisch/qgis2to3/</a></p>
<p>We can download just the scripts folder using the following link:<br /><a href="https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/tree/master/scripts">https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/tree/master/scripts</a></p>
<p>Extract that into a location of your choice.</p>
<p>Then we can run the 2to3 script from the OSGeo4W console (cd to the folder you extracted the script to):</p>
<pre class="lang:sh decode:true ">python 2to3 C:\path_to_plugin\QGIS_Multi_Ring_Buffer</pre>
<p>This will print out changes that need to be made to convert from QGIS2 to QGIS3.</p>
<p>My first run resulted in many lines of:</p>
<pre class="lang:sh decode:true ">RefactoringTool: Line 31: could not convert: from PyQt4.QtCore import *
RefactoringTool: Cannot handle star imports.</pre>
<p>So my plugins line of:</p>
<pre class="lang:python decode:true ">from PyQt4.QtCore import *</pre>
<p>Was impossible to convert with the tool, since I was not 100% sure what I needed from the QtCore library (I was young when I wrote the plugin). I commented out the line for the plugin in QGIS 2.8, booted up QGIS 2.8 and tried running the plugin.</p>
<p>So python errors:<br /><em>NameError: global name 'QVariant' is not defined</em><br /><em>NameError: global name 'Qt' is not defined</em><br />Later. I ended up expanding my other import from QtCore to:</p>
<pre class="lang:python decode:true ">from PyQt4.QtCore import QSettings, QTranslator, qVersion, QCoreApplication, QVariant, Qt</pre>
<p>Running the 2to3 script again looked ok, with a number of changes required. These changes can be applied with &ndash;w flag:</p>
<pre class="lang:sh decode:true ">python 2to3 C:\path_to_plugin\QGIS_Multi_Ring_Buffer -w</pre>
<p>For the next step I booted up my favourite IDE PyCharm. I created a bat file that launched PyCharm with the QGIS dev environmental variables. So copying the &ldquo;python-qgis-dev.bat&rdquo; file from:</p>
<p>I changed the final line of:</p>
<pre class="lang:sh decode:true ">"%PYTHONHOME%\python" %*</pre>
<p>To:</p>
<pre class="lang:sh decode:true ">start /d "C:\Program Files\JetBrains\PyCharm Community Edition 2017.2.1\bin\" pycharm64.exe</pre>
<p>Then from File> Settings> Project:> Project Interpreter> Set to <em>&ldquo;C:\OSGeo4W64\apps\Python36\python.exe&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>It takes a while to update the interpreter.</p>
<p>I only had 2 errors, both for:<br /><em>QgsMapLayerRegistry.instance().addMapLayer(vl)</em></p>
<p>There is a list of API breaks between QGIS 2 and QGIS 3 at:<br /><a href="https://qgis.org/api/api_break.html">https://qgis.org/api/api_break.html</a></p>
<p>Looks like QgsMapLayerRegistry was moved to QgsProject. So I edit it to:</p>
<pre class="lang:python decode:true ">QgsProject.instance().addMapLayer(vl)</pre>
<p>Then we can edit the metadata.txt to QGIS 3:<br /><em>qgisMinimumVersion=3.0</em></p>
<p>And increase the version number.</p>
<p>Then we need to recompile the icon and ui for Python3 and QT5.</p>
<p>I was struggling a bit with the environmental variables to get it working, and ended up using a great batch script form StackExchange:<br /><a href="https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/260743/how-to-compile-qtdesigner-user-interface-ui-and-resource-qrc-files-with-qg">https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/260743/how-to-compile-qtdesigner-user-interface-ui-and-resource-qrc-files-with-qg</a></p>
<pre class="lang:sh decode:true " title="compile.bat">@ECHO OFF

set OSGEO4W_ROOT=C:\OSGeo4W64

set PATH=%OSGEO4W_ROOT%\bin;%PATH%
set PATH=%PATH%;%OSGEO4W_ROOT%\apps\qgis\bin

@echo off
call "%OSGEO4W_ROOT%\bin\o4w_env.bat"
call "%OSGEO4W_ROOT%\bin\qt5_env.bat"
call "%OSGEO4W_ROOT%\bin\py3_env.bat"
@echo off
path %OSGEO4W_ROOT%\apps\qgis-dev\bin;%OSGEO4W_ROOT%\apps\grass\grass-7.2.2\lib;%OSGEO4W_ROOT%\apps\grass\grass-7.2.2\bin;%PATH%

cd /d %~dp0

@ECHO ON
::Ui Compilation
call pyuic5 multi_ring_buffer_dialog_base.ui -o multi_ring_buffer_dialog_base.py          

::Resources
call pyrcc5 resources.qrc -o resources_rc.py

@ECHO OFF
GOTO END

:ERROR
   echo "Failed!"
   set ERRORLEVEL=%ERRORLEVEL%
   pause

:END
@ECHO ON</pre>
<p>So create the .bat file and run it in the folder of you plugin (editing where needed). <strong>Note: Your resources_rc may be called resource_rc or something slightly different.</strong></p>
<p>Move the plugin folder to:<br />C:\\Users\\<strong>USERNAME</strong>\\AppData\\Roaming\\QGIS\\QGIS3\\profiles\\default\\python\\plugins\\</p>
<p>Boot up QGIS2.99/3.</p>
<p>I had a few more issues.</p>
<p>It seems QGIS 3 deals with the icon slightly differently.</p>
<p>icon_rc.py is no longer needed, and it seems was not used on my other plugin either.</p>
<p>So I removed the reference to it in the main python script:<br /><em>from . import icon_rc</em></p>
<p>I still had some errors.</p>
<p><em>AttributeError: module 'qgis.PyQt.QtGui' has no attribute 'QDialog'</em></p>
<p>It seems QDialog has moved to PyQt.QtWidgets.</p>
<p>So in my multi_ring_buffer_dialog.py file I needed to change some lines:</p>
<p>Add:</p>
<pre class="lang:python decode:true ">from qgis.PyQt.QtWidgets import QDialog, QDialogButtonBox</pre>
<p>Change:<br /><em>QtGui.QDialog</em><br />to:<br /><em>QDialog</em><br />In the two instances in that file.</p>
<p><strong>Working plugin!</strong></p>
<p>Commit the changes back to the repo. Cd to the directory in git shell.</p>
<pre class="lang:sh decode:true ">git add -A
git commit &ndash;m &ldquo;Updated for QGIS 3&rdquo;
git push</pre>
<p>Zip the plugin up.<br />Upload to <a href="https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/">https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/</a></p>
<p><strong>Second plugin:</strong><br />Same issue with import *<br />1 error with QgsMapLayerRegistry<br />My resources_rc file was called resource_rc so the batch script needed to be edited to:<br />call pyrcc5 resources.qrc -o resource_rc.py<br />Same issues with QtGui.QDialog</p>
<p>Now time for some improvements.</p>
