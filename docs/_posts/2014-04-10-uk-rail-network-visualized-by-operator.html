<p><strong>Update:</strong> see the weekly updated version at: <a href="http://gisforthought.com/uk-rail-network-map">UK Rail Network Map</a></p>
<p>The United Kingdom's railway network is split up into regional franchises, these franchises are run by private companies who bid on the work. So for example ScotRail, which runs the trains in Scotland is owned by the <a title="first group" href="http://www.firstgroup.com/" target="_blank">FIrst Group</a>, who also run a number of other regional franchises. This can however change, when the contracts are up for bid.</p>
<p>Interestingly there is also a governmental holding company (<a title="Directly Operated" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directly_Operated_Railways" target="_blank">Directly Operated Railways</a>), which can take over a franchise if necessary, they currently run East Coast Trains.</p>
<p>For this visualization I have grouped&nbsp;Serco-Abellio and&nbsp;Abellio as&nbsp;Serco/Abellio.</p>
<p>EDIT: Like mentioned in the <a title="Public Transport Connections Between Scotland and the Rest of the UK" href="http://gisforthought.com/public-transport-connections-between-scotland-and-the-uk/">Scotland to the Rest&nbsp;of the UK</a>, lines are drawn between stations on a route. So a direct route from Glasgow to London would be a direct line between the two terminus stations.</p>
