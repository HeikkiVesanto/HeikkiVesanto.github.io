# Github Pages

My old hosting provider had a data breach so they shut down completely:

['No Support Linux Hosting' Shuts Down After Cyberattack](https://it.slashdot.org/story/21/02/09/1933204/no-support-linux-hosting-shuts-down-after-cyberattack)

But that wasn't really a surprise, as I was only paying $1 per month.

Luckily I had all my posts archived in regular e-mails from WordPress, and using a combination of Flickr, Archive.org, and the original posts I think I have recovered all of the images as well.

So we are now on Github pages. 

I ended up creating a few parsers to replace the images and links on the page:

[image_parser.py](https://github.com/HeikkiVesanto/HeikkiVesanto.github.io/blob/main/docs/python_parsers/image_parser.py)

[link_parser.py](https://github.com/HeikkiVesanto/HeikkiVesanto.github.io/blob/main/docs/python_parsers/link_parser.py)

If you notice any issues drop me a line of Twitter: [HeikkiVesanto](https://twitter.com/HeikkiVesanto)

Thanks.
