<p>For this example we are using Ordnance Survey MasterMap Topology Layer data.</p>
<p>MasterMap Topo Sample Data:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/business-and-government/licensing/sample-data/discover-data.html">https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/business-and-government/licensing/sample-data/discover-data.html</a></p>
<p>Now we know that we can maintain an attribute through layers, as we saw in the shp to DXF example, the export of MasterMap should be straightforward.</p>
<p>Let's first see what the GML file contains.</p>
<pre class="lang:sh decode:true">ogrinfo -so os-mastermap-topography-layer-sample-data.gml</pre>
<pre class="lang:sh decode:true ">Had to open data source read-only.
INFO: Open of 'os-mastermap-topography-layer-sample-data.gml'
using driver 'GML' successful.
1: TopographicArea (Polygon)
2: CartographicText (Point)
3: CartographicSymbol (Point)
4: BoundaryLine (Line String)
5: TopographicPoint (Point)
6: TopographicLine (Line String)</pre>
<p>So we have 6 layers in total.</p>
<p>For MasterMap in CAD we will be mainly interested in CartographicText, TopographicPoint, and TopographicLine.</p>
<p>Lets start with TopographicLine.</p>
<pre class="lang:sh decode:true ">ogrinfo -so os-mastermap-topography-layer-sample-data.gml TopographicLine</pre>
<p>Nothing too useful.</p>
<p>A bit more details:</p>
<pre class="lang:sh decode:true ">ogrinfo os-mastermap-topography-layer-sample-data.gml TopographicLine</pre>
<p>Sample:</p>
<pre class="lang:sh decode:true">OGRFeature(TopographicLine):185
fid (String) = osgb1000000347615024
featureCode (Integer) = 10019
version (Integer) = 5
versionDate (String) = 2005-03-30
theme (StringList) = (2:Buildings,Land)
accuracyOfPosition (String) = 1.0m
changeDate (StringList) = (4:1994-01-26,2003-11-10,2004-02-19,2005-01-05)
reasonForChange (StringList) = (4:Modified,Attributes,Attributes,Attributes)
descriptiveGroup (String) = Building
physicalLevel (Integer) = 50
physicalPresence (String) = Obstructing
descriptiveTerm (String) = Outline
make (String) = Manmade
nonBoundingLine (String) = (null)
LINESTRING (...)</pre>
<p>For this feature the "descriptiveGroup"" seems the most useful, and from reading the os-mastermap-topography-layer-user-guide.pdf the best would be either a combination of descriptiveGroup and descriptiveTerm or using the featureCode. Since this is a simple conversion we will just use a combo of descriptiveGroup and descriptiveTerm to create our DXF layers.</p>
<p>I will be using || for concatenation, which works with the SQlite SQL dialect.</p>
<pre class="lang:sh decode:true ">ogr2ogr -f DXF TopographicLine.dxf os-mastermap-topography-layer-sample-data.gml TopographicLine -sql "select descriptiveGroup || ' - ' || descriptiveTerm as Layer from TopographicLine" -dialect SQlite</pre>
<p>Result:</p>
<pre class="lang:sh decode:true ">layer names ignored in combination with -sql.
ERROR 1: No known way to write feature with geometry 'None'.
ERROR 1: Unable to write feature 0 from layer SELECT.

ERROR 1: Terminating translation prematurely after failed
translation from sql statement.</pre>
<p>Not quite. Seems to be missing geometry, perhaps a SQL select issue.</p>
<p>This can be tested with:</p>
<pre class="lang:sh decode:true ">ogrinfo os-mastermap-topography-layer-sample-data.gml TopographicLine -sql "select descriptiveGroup || ' - ' || descriptiveTerm as Layer from TopographicLine" -dialect SQLITE</pre>
<p>Result:</p>
<pre class="lang:sh decode:true ">OGRFeature(SELECT):14634
Layer (String) = Building - Outline

OGRFeature(SELECT):14635
Layer (String) = Building - Outline</pre>
<p>So we do not have any geometry. Lets bring that in.</p>
<pre class="lang:sh decode:true ">ogr2ogr -f DXF TopographicLine.dxf os-mastermap-topography-layer-sample-data.gml TopographicLine -sql "select descriptiveGroup || ' - ' || descriptiveTerm as Layer, * from TopographicLine" -dialect SQLITE</pre>
<p>Geometry looks good:</p>
<p><a title="Screenshot[6]" href="https://gisforthought.com/media/2015-10-26_2015-10-26_21988887960_6438c3ffd0_o.png" data-flickr-embed="true"><img src="https://gisforthought.com/media/2015-10-26_2015-10-26_21988887960_6438c3ffd0_o.png" alt="Screenshot[6]"/></a></p>
<p>But if we check the attributes in QGIS:</p>
<p><a title="Screenshot[7]" href="https://gisforthought.com/media/2015-10-26_2015-10-26_22187246431_913c5a2bcd_o.png" data-flickr-embed="true"><img src="https://gisforthought.com/media/2015-10-26_2015-10-26_22187246431_913c5a2bcd_o.png" alt="Screenshot[7]"/></a></p>
<p>We can see that all of the attributes that are not 0 have both a descriptiveGroup and a descriptiveTerm, which was not what we can see in the ogrinfo summary. So our SQL statement is cutting some out.</p>
<p>Try again:</p>
<pre class="lang:sh decode:true ">ogr2ogr -f DXF TopographicLine2.dxf os-mastermap-topography-layer-sample-data.gml TopographicLine -sql "select descriptiveGroup ||' - '|| coalesce(descriptiveTerm,'') as Layer, * from TopographicLine" -dialect SQLITE</pre>
<p>Looking better:</p>
<p><a title="Screenshot[8]" href="https://gisforthought.com/media/2015-10-26_2015-10-26_22176969335_cb9708a622_o.png" data-flickr-embed="true"><img src="https://gisforthought.com/media/2015-10-26_2015-10-26_22176969335_cb9708a622_o.png" alt="Screenshot[8]"/></a></p>
<p>But it won't open in AutoCAD DWG TrueView. Lets try running it through a ShapeFile format first before the DXF conversion.</p>
<pre class="lang:sh decode:true ">ogr2ogr TopographicLine.shp os-mastermap-topography-layer-sample-data.gml TopographicLine -sql "select descriptiveGroup || ' - ' || coalesce(descriptiveTerm,'') as Layer, * from TopographicLine" -dialect SQLITE

ogr2ogr -f DXF TopographicLine3.dxf TopographicLine.shp</pre>
<p>Success:</p>
<p><a title="Screenshot[9]" href="https://gisforthought.com/media/2015-10-26_2015-10-26_21554205754_5a38c19a4b_o.png" data-flickr-embed="true"><img src="https://gisforthought.com/media/2015-10-26_2015-10-26_21554205754_5a38c19a4b_o.png" alt="Screenshot[9]"/></a></p>
<p>No indication of why a direct GML to DXF conversion would hang TrueView, and your mileage with other CAD software may vary. But ShapeFile is a very simplified geometry format, so perhaps running through that helps with some more complex geometry in the GML. Hard to say with no errors from TrueView, just a stuck program.</p>
<p>Repeat for point:</p>
<pre class="lang:sh decode:true">ogr2ogr -f DXF TopographicPoint.dxf TopographicPoint.shp

ogr2ogr TopographicPoint.shp os-mastermap-topography-layer-sample-data.gml TopographicPoint -sql "select descriptiveGroup || ' - ' || coalesce(descriptiveTerm,'') as Layer, * from TopographicPoint" -dialect SQLITE</pre>
