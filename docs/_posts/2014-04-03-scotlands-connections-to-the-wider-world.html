<p>On the verge of the <a title="Scottish vote" href="http://www.scotreferendum.com/">Scottish vote for independence</a>&nbsp;here is a look at all of the scheduled passenger connections between Scotland and outside of the UK. As it is, there are only flights. There are a few ferries between Northern Ireland and Scotland, however NI is still within the UK. No conclusions just an interesting visualisation.</p>
