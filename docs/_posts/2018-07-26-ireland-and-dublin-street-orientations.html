<p>Based on the work by:</p>
<p>Geoff Boeing: <a href="https://geoffboeing.com/2018/07/comparing-city-street-orientations/">Comparing City Street Orientations</a></p>
<p>Rixx: <a href="https://rixx.de/blog/street-orientantions/">Street Orientations</a></p>
<p>The graphs show the percentage of streets that run in a certain orientation. So for a grid based city like Chicago, there will be a heavy bias in north/south and east/west streets. Bearing in mind north and south will be the same (unless there are one-way streets, which only count in the direction they run in).</p>
<p>But for older cities that formed naturally, without modern city planning, the streets should be more varied.</p>
<p><strong>Ireland:</strong></p>
<p>Largest populated places by population. Based on the <a href="https://data.gov.ie/dataset/settlements-ungeneralised-osi-national-statistical-boundaries">Ordnance Survey Ireland urban areas</a>. As it is OSI data, Northern Ireland is not included.</p>

<p><strong>Dublin Postcodes:</strong></p>
<p>Some areas are clearly impacted by large motorways running through them.</p>

<p>And for non-Dubliners, a map of the postal district boundaries:</p>

<p>I updated the script by Rixx, so that it would take a ShapeFile as an input with a few caveats (it must be WGS84, it must have an attribute that has the are name and it must be called settl_name).</p>
