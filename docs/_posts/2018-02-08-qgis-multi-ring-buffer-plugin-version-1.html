<p>After about 3 years of existing. I am releasing version 1 of the Multi Ring Buffer Plugin.</p>
<p><a href="https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/Multi_Ring_Buffer/">QGIS plugin repository.</a></p>

<p>With version 1 comes a few new features:</p>
<li>Ability to choose the layer to buffer after launching the plugin</li>
<li>Ability to supply buffer distances as comma separated text string</li>
<li>Ability to make non-doughnut buffers</li>
<p>Doughnut buffer:<br />

<p>Non-doughnut buffer (regular):<br />

<p>Works either in a sequential manner by buffering the resulting buffer and differencing the previous buffer, or a central manner by buffering the original feature with different distances. Also by default the buffer dissolves the features before buffering.</p>

<p>Dissolving makes adjacent features behave in a better manner without overlapping buffers. The QGIS buffer feature has the logic behind this.</p>
