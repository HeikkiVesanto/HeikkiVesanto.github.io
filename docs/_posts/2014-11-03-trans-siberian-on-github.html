<p>One of the easiest and low-cost ways of getting your data online is by using GitHub. While mainly aimed for code, it can be used for other things as well.</p>
<p>A great feature is the rendering of <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/mapping-geojson-files-on-github/" title="Json as Map" target="_blank">.geojson files as maps</a> automatically.</p>
<p>I have a .geojson file of a Trans-Siberian journey in WGS84 (currently the only supported projection). I copy and past this to <a href="https://gist.github.com/HeikkiVesanto/dc867a87e81f02ce31a8" title="GitHub" target="_blank">gist.GitHub.com</a> and name the file TransSiberianSimplified.geojson (I think lowercase is important in the file type). It is then automatically turned into a slippy map. This can then be embedded (for WordPress I have done this by creating a simple html page which simply contains the relevant script, and embedded it using an iframe plugin).</p>
