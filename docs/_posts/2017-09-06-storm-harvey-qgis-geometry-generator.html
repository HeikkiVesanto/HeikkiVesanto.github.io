<p>Storm Harvey produced some extremely high levels of rainfall. Some areas of Texas received over 50 inches of rain over 9 days.</p>
<p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (<a href="http://www.noaa.gov/">NOAA</a>) provided some really great real time datasets to map the progress of the storm.</p>
<p>Among these were:<br />
<a href="http://www.srh.noaa.gov/ridge2/RFC_Precip/">Hourly Precipitation</a><br />
and<br />
<a href="http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/gis/">Hurricane Path</a></p>
<p>From these we can produce a GIF of hourly precipitation:<br />

<p>And total precipitation:<br />

<p>Particularly the hurricane path was possible to create in QGIS using the Atlas Generator, and the excellent new:ish geometry generator. This can be found as an option for any layers symbology, as one of the renderers.</p>
<p>For my map I had a non spatial table that drove my atlas. This was a log table of all of the hours of precipitation I had loaded into my database. So I looped through each entry and showed the corresponding points of hourly precipitation for the corresponding hour. I also had hurricane path data as points for every 6 hours. So I could use the geometry generator to interpolate points in between known points.</p>
<p>While the query ended up being pretty long it is pretty straightforward.</p>
<p>It only needs to be run when the hour being generated does not end with a 00, 06, 12, or 18, because those are the positions I already know.</p>
<p>For the rest I need to generate two points. One for the previously known point, and one for the next known point.</p>
<p>Then I would create a line between those two points, measure the line, and place a point on the line x times one sixth of the way for the start of the line depending on the hour from the last known point.</p>
<p>Overall I am very impressed and happy with the result. With a bit of data defined rotation the storm progress looks great.</p>
