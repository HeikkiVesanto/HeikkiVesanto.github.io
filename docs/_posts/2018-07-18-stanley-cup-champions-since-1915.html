<p>The average locations were created using a window function in PostgreSQL. We can utilise the geography type to take into account the curvature of the earth and make the calculation on a spheroid.</p>
<p>So for the average location of the last five years:</p>
<pre class="lang:pgsql decode:true ">select id,
ST_Centroid(st_collect(geom)
over (ORDER BY id ROWS BETWEEN 4 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW)::geography,
True)::geometry as five_year_cent
from nhl.winner_1915</pre>
