<p>Mapvember: <em>A map/tutorial a day for every day in November</em>.</p>
<p>Some days had more than one map, some had tutorials, one just had a photo. Some were very easy, others would have take a couple of days of work.</p>
<p>Excellent experience, good learning experience and an opportunity to post previous projects that were a bit short of being great. A little time consuming at times though. I started making the maps around half way through October, so I had almost the first week ready when November began, but the days ticked by quickly. Happy to have done it. I encourage everyone to join in next year, or any other month.</p>
