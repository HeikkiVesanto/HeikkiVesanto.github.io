<p>The Great Polish Map of Scotland is located on the grounds of the <a title="Barony Castle Hotel" href="http://www.baronycastle.com/">Barony Castle Hotel</a>. Found near the borders town of&nbsp;Eddleston, just north of Peebles, or a 50 minute drive from Edinburgh.&nbsp;We visited it on our way north from England, which didn't take use too much out of our way.&nbsp;It is free to visit so a must visit for all map enthusiasts in Scotland or Northern England.</p>

<p>Built between 1974 and 1979 to a scale of 1:10000 it is truly impressive to behold (50 m x 40 m on the ground). It is the largest known physical representation of a country and the largest outdoor relief map in the world (signpost at the map). Envisioned by Jan Tomasik, a Polish sergeant. He had been station in Galashiels during WW2, and added the Hotel Black Barony to his holdings in 1968, providing the map a location. The map itself was built in stages over a number of years, with Polish exchange students providing some of the manpower required.</p>
<p>The map is now maintained by <a title="Mapa Scotland" href="http://www.mapascotland.org/">Mapa Scotland</a>. A charity who are now working on restoring the map. Parts of it are currently in poor condition, but overall it is an impressive site.</p>
<p>Also the grounds of the hotel in general are really beautiful, with a small glen running through the site, if visiting the Scottish Borders it would make a great place to stay: <a title="Barony Castle" href="http://www.baronycastle.com/">Barony Castle Hotel</a>.</p>
<p>
When arriving at the hotel there is a path just to the left of the castle:<br />
