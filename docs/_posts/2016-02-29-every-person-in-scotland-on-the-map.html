<p>The mapping process creates a random point within a building shell inside of a postcode area, which is repeated for every person in a postcode. This is in contrast to a simpler process, which does not take into account buildings at all, working simply with postcode areas. This can be seen in my previous post: <a href="http://gisforthought.com/population-of-scotland-mapped/">Population of Scotland Mapped</a></p>
