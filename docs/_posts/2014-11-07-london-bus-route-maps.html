<p>There are some great features in QGIS 2.6 atlas generation. You can for example filter visible polygons using an attribute from the feature controlling the atlas. So I have a full bus routes extent layer, and one with each direction. The two maps are thus filtered by the full extent layer. Data from Transport for London.</p>
<p>My rules look like:<br />
regexp_substr( group,'(\\w$)') = 1 AND regexp_substr( group,'(\\w+)') = attribute($atlasfeature, 'route') AND $map = 'map1'<br />
and<br />
regexp_substr( group,'(\\w$)') = 2 AND regexp_substr( group,'(\\w+)') = attribute($atlasfeature, 'route') AND $map = 'map2'</p>
<p>Thus we can split the features into the two different maps in the composer. We can filter going and return using the "regexp_substr( group,'(\\w$)') = 1", since our routes are originally names 101-1 for example for the outgoing and 101-2 for the return.</p>
<p>The Vector Map District background map styling is thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/mixedbredie">Ross</a> : <a href="https://github.com/mixedbredie/QGIS-styles/tree/master/OSVMD/Greyscale">https://github.com/mixedbredie/QGIS-styles/tree/master/OSVMD/Greyscale</a><br />
With slight modifications.</p>
<p>The PDFs turned out quite well due to the vector source data:<br />
