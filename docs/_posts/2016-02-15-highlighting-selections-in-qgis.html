<p>I have been working a lot with points recently, and one thing with the default selection highlighting in QGIS is that selections do not really stand out. This is especially true with point layers.</p>
<p>A bit of an extreme example, but there are 15 points selected in the middle of this image.</p>

<p>However, we can remedy this with the Expression Plus plugin (by <a href="http://nathanw.net/">Nathan Woodrow</a>) and a rule based symbology.</p>
<p><img src="https://gisforthought.com/media/2016-02-15_24852575051_2ce2a230cb_b.jpg" alt="plugin"/></p>
<p>This plugin adds a great function: <em>isselected()</em></p>
<p>With this we can easily create rule to symbolise features that are selected.</p>
<p>The rule for symbology is as follows:</p>
<p><strong>QGIS 2.12+:</strong></p>
<pre class="lang:sh decode:true " >isselected( @layer_name )</pre>
<p><strong>QGIS 2.8:</strong></p>
<pre class="lang:sh decode:true " >isselected( 'ACTUAL_NAME_OF_LAYER' )</pre>
<p>So we can see that 2.12 has added a slightly more dynamic way of applying the symbology.</p>

<p>We can now slightly more easily see our selection.</p>
<p><img src="https://gisforthought.com/media/2016-02-15_24315317594_634e42104e_b.jpg" alt="more_visible"/></p>
<p>But one final setting. With symbol levels we can really make the selections pop.</p>
<p><img src="https://gisforthought.com/media/2016-02-15_24315317484_01946c27a1.jpg" alt="symbol_levels"/></p>
<p>Symbol levels can be set from the bottom right of the styles tab, through rendering order. We simply want out selection to have a higher number than the other symbologies. Thus being rendered in a later pass and appearing on top.</p>

<p>Much better.</p>
