<p>There is an excellent plugin for Leaflet called&nbsp;Leaflet.Photo.</p>
<p>The plugin was created by&nbsp;<a href="http://thematicmapping.org/">Bj&oslash;rn Sandvik</a>. See the full post: &nbsp;<a href="http://blog.thematicmapping.org/2014/08/showing-geotagged-photos-on-leaflet-map.html">http://blog.thematicmapping.org/2014/08/showing-geotagged-photos-on-leaflet-map.html</a></p>
<p>The plugin has a number of examples that show usage with image hosting platforms, like Google Photos and Instagram, which have assicaited API's for returning information about the image in question.</p>
<p>I was however keen to host the sollution completely myself, so simply have a folder of images that would populate on the map if they had exif&nbsp;GPS information.</p>
<p>I have created an example available on GitHub:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/HeikkiVesanto/Leaflet.Photo/tree/gh-pages/local_file_example">https://github.com/HeikkiVesanto/Leaflet.Photo/tree/gh-pages/local_file_example</a></p>
<p>Simply download the full repo:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/HeikkiVesanto/Leaflet.Photo">https://github.com/HeikkiVesanto/Leaflet.Photo</a></p>
<p>Copy the local_file_example folder. Replace the images in the Photos folder with your own photos. Load it onto any php supporting webhost.</p>
<p>Like:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.bluehost.com/track/gisforthought/">BlueHost</a></p>
<p>Or for more advanced users, the examples below are on:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=f67c2dabcf79">DigitalOcean</a></p>
<p>And link to the folder with the index.html</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p><iframe src="http://maps.gisforthought.com/local_file_example/index_thumb.html" width="100%"></iframe></p>
<p><a href="http://maps.gisforthought.com/local_file_example/index_thumb.html">Link.</a></p>
