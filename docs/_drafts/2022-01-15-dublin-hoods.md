Neighborhood boundaries are a fascinating topic. Where do people see their neighborhood extending to, how clear are those boundaries, and how do they shift with time.

This is a topic that has been tackled a number of times in different locations. With the general public asked to draw their own neighborhood, or the ones they are familiar with, on a map. But there are challenges.

Very successfully in [Boston](https://bostonography.com/2017/official-unofficial-neighborhoods-2017/). Boston only has around 60 neighborhoods, which are reletively clearly defined based on the mapping results. And they also clearly had a grear readership and receivied a very good response, with over 2300 responses.

Older cities, like Glasgow are much more comple. In 2016 I did a similar survey, and from 367 responses I recivied 241 unique neighborhoods. You would need a much bigger set of responses to come to any real conclusions. But I still mapped the results for the West End of Glasgow, where most neighborhoods had multiple responses: [Glasgow Regions Mapped](https://gisforthought.com/glasgow-regions-mapped-progress-update-1/)

The challenges for Dublin are similar to Glasgow, although not as complex, anything interesting would require a lot of responses.

Luckily the Dublin InQuirer decided to run a similar project, polling their subscribers for responses. The number of submissions was good, not quite beating the Boston response yet, but getting close. 2200 responses and 133 unique neighborhoods. They also did a few great things, one was that the data was made available to download. This meant that anyone could map the results, which is great. Additionally they are reaching out to areas with less responses, which is a great effort on their part.

Might be better to not use landuse, but elevation for the colours.
